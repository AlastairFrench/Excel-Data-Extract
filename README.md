# Excel-Data-Extract
Python script to extract data from a specific excel file which is generated during a measurement from a bespoke machine/software.

An instrument that I use at work produces an excel file for each measurement it takes with the data and other information from the measurement. In order to quickly collate all of the measurements from the excel files I wrote this python script.

Due to confidentiality all of the variables have had to be anonymised .
